# Applying Reinforcement Learning in Quantitative Trading

## Overview  

This is the repository of yuriak's graduate thesis which aims to use reinforcement learning in quantitative trading.
Two types of RL models were experimented and could make good performance in the back-test:
1. Policy Gradient
    - Vanilla Policy Gradient (not implemented in this repo)
    - Multi-Task Recurrent Policy Gradient (RPG)
2. Direct RL
    - Vanilla DRL (DRL) 
    - A hybrid network involves news embedding vectors (DRL with news)

I have debugged some functions and plan to improve it for a research purpose. 
## Experiments

```.ipynb``` files were details of experiments.

This repository contains 3 types of environments:  
1. CryptoCurrency (Huobi): ```env/crc_env.py```  
2. End of day US stock prices (quandl): ```env/stock_env.py```  
3. Continuous Futures (quandl): ```env/futures_env.py```  

And, 2 types of agents:  
1. DRL: ```agents/drl_agent.py``` and ```agents/drl_news_agent.py```  
2. RPG: ```agents/rpg_agent.py``` and ```agents/rpg_news_agent.py```  


Also, there are some history codes in ```history``` and ```model_archive``` which have been deprecated, but contains some early ideas, please feel free to use them.
